    "## Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary objectives for the project are to create something novel, useful and innovative with Python code. You can draw your inspiration from the many examples given to you throughout the semester. Your project should clearly and explicitly demonstrate the level of programming knowledge that you have acquired in this course. The type of project you propose is up to you. Ultimately you are evaluated based on not only the idea itself but your execution of it, therefore your **project should be a representaiton of you and your abilities as a programmer.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our role is to help you to scope your idea. If it is simple enough we will expect a full implementation, if it’s complex then we’ll ask for a manifestation of your idea as a minimum viable product. It should be a proof of concept demonstrating how the bigger system might work. That being said, it is important to engage your small group instructor as they are the evaluator of your work. It can only make your project and your grade better.\n"

ALWAYS include a URL to the source, unless it came from the course itself, in which you should state where it came from in the course (lesson 04 lab, lesson 05 homework, lesson 06 large group, etc. Its a good idea to have at least two sources in case one does not work out. \n",
